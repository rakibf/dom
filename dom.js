- JavaScript makes webpages interactive with the help of DOM

- What is DOM?

1. D for Document => HTML creates the main structure of a website. This HTML file is a document.
2. O for Object => The HTML document consists of HTML elements. For JavaScript to work with HTML elements, browser converts the elements into JS objects. So, HTML elements are the objects of the document.
3. M for Model => Every HTML document has a tree structure. This tree structure is called the Model.

- Through DOM we can do CRUD operation.
